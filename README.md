# html-boilerplate
A handy boilerplate project which includes jQuery, LESS.js and a useful list of base LESS mixins and functions. This project is simply a useful starting point for my own development. It includes all of the basic features I have to manually add every time I start working on a project from scratch. I figured it was best suited for Github rather than my own HDD, since I can access it from any machine. 

Hopefully it will be useful for other devs too, so please feel free to fork at your leisure and make any improvements you can think of.

### What's included?

I've tried to include all of the useful things that people might need in their projects, without adding too much bloat to the core. Hopefully it should be customisable enough, but acts as a great starting point.
